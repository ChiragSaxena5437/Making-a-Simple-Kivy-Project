# Making-a-Simple-Kivy-Project
The files upload in this repository are used to guide a beginer to make a simple kivy frontend 
using very basic and fundamental components of frontend programming like labels , button and 
programs like mousetracker and at last with module one we have created  a very simple kivy app using screenmanger
for navigation between screens and also used labels and buttons so tyhat you can customize it accordingly.
Precations:
As usual in programming please match the kivy version used in the code with the version of kivy You are using.
Also if you are using these codes in jupyter with several kernels please make sure you clear the outputs generated by the previous kernels
otherwise you may get an error it even i am also not sure about this error maybe this error have been rectified in your version of kivy
or jupyter notebook.
Happy Coding!!
